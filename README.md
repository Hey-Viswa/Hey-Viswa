🔭 Summary

I’m a full-stack web developer who loves taking ideas from concept → production. I work across the MERN stack to build scalable backends, clean frontends, real-time features, and production-ready systems. Recently I’ve focused on building StudioFlow, an end-to-end workflow SaaS for creative teams — shipping features like RBAC v2, real-time updates, background workers, payments, and secure file delivery. 

Profile

Core outcomes from StudioFlow

Built Node.js + Express backend with modular architecture

MongoDB for scalable models, Redis + BullMQ for background jobs

WebSockets for real-time updates, AWS S3 for file storage

Razorpay integration for milestone billing + webhook automation

RBAC V2: Owners / Team Members / Clients + ownership transfer

Deployed: frontend on Vercel, backend on Railway

Production result: used for real client deliveries (video editing projects).
